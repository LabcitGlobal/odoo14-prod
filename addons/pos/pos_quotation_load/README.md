About
============
Do you want to load quotation to POS? Do you do that manually? so it's quite a time-consuming task, here we build a module to easily load a quotation in POS. Easy to sync quotation with POS system. You will also easily search quotation in pos. We have also given a field in quotation to identify quotation sync with pos. You can also get pos order reference number in the quotation. the quotation will be canceled automatically after POS order is done.
